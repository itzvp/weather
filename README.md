## Known Issues or Limitations

- **Error Handling**: Current error handling is basic and might not cover all edge cases.
- **API Limitations**: The free tier of the OpenWeatherMap API has usage limits. For higher limits, consider upgrading to a paid plan.
- **Responsive Design**: While the application is mostly responsive, further testing and tweaks might be necessary for all device sizes.
